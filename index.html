        <h2>RFC 8994 Autonomic Control Plane</h2>
        <p class='lead'>"Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which
          depends on some addressing and routing.  This Autonomic Control Plane
          should ideally be self-managing, and as independent as possible of
          configuration.  This document defines such a plane and calls it the
          "Autonomic Control Plane", with the primary use as a control plane
          for autonomic functions.  It also serves as a "virtual out-of-band
          channel" for Operations, Administration and Management (OAM)
          communications over a network that provides automatically configured
          hop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via
          automatically configured IPv6 even when the network is not
          configured, or misconfigured."</p>

        <h2>RFC 8995 Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure</h2>
        <p class='lead'>"This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic
        Control Plane.  To do this, a Secure Key Infrastructure is
        bootstrapped.  This is done using manufacturer-installed
        X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing
        service, both online and offline.  We call this process the
        Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol.
        Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a
        cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or
        limited/disconnected networks. Support for deployment models
        with less stringent security requirements is included.
        Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new
        key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The
        established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued
        certificate to the device as well."</p>

        <h1>GRASP</h1>
        <h2>RFC 8990 A Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol</h2>
        <p class='lead'>"This document specifies the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol
          (GRASP), which enables autonomic nodes and autonomic service agents
          to dynamically discover peers, to synchronize state with each other,
          and to negotiate parameter settings with each other.  GRASP depends
          on an external security environment that is described elsewhere.  The
          technical objectives and parameters for specific application
          scenarios are to be described in separate documents.  Appendices
          briefly discuss requirements for the protocol and existing protocols
          with comparable features."</p>
